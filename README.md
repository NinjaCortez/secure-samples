# Moto Secure Code Review

Couple quick examples from Moto Secure Code Review

1) super-funnel-index.php file is an example of cleaning up / minimizing some PHP variables from the main index file.

2) custom.js file is a quick (not tested or functioning) example of cleaning up the duplicated ajax functionality, while sticking with exisitng jQuery setup, localizing PHP variables and adding scope to some variables.

Both examples are mainly to show better DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principals.
